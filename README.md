# SehomeSeamonstersWebsite

The website I created for the Sehome High School robotics team during my time on the team. The website URL is [sehomeseamonsters.org](http://www.sehomeseamonsters.org) but they are using a different site now due to school board rules. 

[This psd file](https://github.com/lb7/SehomeSeamonstersWebsite/blob/master/seamonsters%20site.psd) is the reference I used for the design of the site.
